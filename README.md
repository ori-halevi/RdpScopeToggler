# 

# \*\*RdpScopeToggler\*\* is a powerful Windows application that provides granular control over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to your computer. Take full control of who can connect to your machine, when they can connect, and for how long.

# 

# \## üöÄ Features

# 

# \### Smart Access Control

# \- \*\*Local Address List\*\*: Define addresses that should always have access (marked as "Local" but supports both local and remote addresses)

# \- \*\*Whitelist Management\*\*: Flexible whitelist system with enable/disable functionality

# \- \*\*Time-Based Control\*\*: Set specific time windows for RDP access

# \- \*\*Duration Limits\*\*: Configure maximum connection duration with automatic disconnection

# 

# \### Real-Time Status Monitoring

# The application provides four distinct status indicators to keep you informed:

# 

# 1\. \*\*üìã Whitelist Status\*\* - Shows current whitelist state

# 2\. \*\*üåê General List Status\*\* - Displays general access rules status  

# 3\. \*\*üîì Open to All\*\* - Indicates when RDP is open to all addresses (no filtering)

# 4\. \*\*üè† Local Only\*\* - Shows when access is restricted to local addresses only

# 

# \### Automated Notifications

# \- \*\*Toast Listener Service\*\*: On first run, installs `RdpScopeTogglerToastListener`

# \- \*\*Pre-Disconnection Alerts\*\*: Receives notifications before scheduled disconnections

# \- \*\*Always Scheduled\*\*: Every operation requires a scheduled disconnection time for security

# 

# \### Setting Up Access Lists

# 

# 1\. \*\*Local Address List\*\*: Add addresses that should always have RDP access

# &nbsp;  - Despite the "Local" name, you can add both local and remote IP addresses

# &nbsp;  - These addresses bypass time restrictions

# 

# 2\. \*\*Whitelist\*\*: Configure addresses with time-based access control

# &nbsp;  - Enable/disable the entire whitelist as needed

# &nbsp;  - Set specific time windows for access

# &nbsp;  - Configure automatic disconnection times

# 

# \### Managing RDP Access

# 

# \- \*\*Monitor Status\*\*: Use the four status indicators to track current access state

# \- \*\*Schedule Disconnections\*\*: All access grants must include a scheduled end time

# \- \*\*Receive Notifications\*\*: Get alerts before automatic disconnections occur

# 

# \## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

# 

# \- \*\*Mandatory Scheduling\*\*: Every RDP access operation requires a scheduled disconnection time

# \- \*\*Administrator Rights\*\*: The application requires admin privileges to modify RDP settings

# \- \*\*Automatic Notifications\*\*: The toast listener ensures you're always aware of upcoming disconnections

# 

# \## üîß Technical Details
